This Jenkins Pipeline script is designed to run a simple test using a Docker container with the Python 3.9 Alpine image. To use it, create a new Jenkins Pipeline job and copy the script into the Pipeline script section. The script defines an agent that specifies the Docker image, and it has a single 'Test' stage that prints the Python version. Ensure Jenkins and Docker are installed. For more details, refer to the provided Jenkinsfile and adjust it to your needs.
